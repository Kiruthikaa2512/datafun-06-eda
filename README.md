## Repository Creation and Local Setup

This document outlines the initial steps taken to set up the GitHub repository and local development environment for the **Project 6: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.


### 1. GitHub Repository Creation

* Created a new GitHub repository named **`datafun-06-eda`** via the GitHub web interface.
* Initialized the repository with a default `README.md` file.

### 2. Cloning Repository Locally

* Cloned the repository to the local machine into the `Documents` folder using:
git clone https://github.com/Kiruthikaa2512/datafun-06-eda.git


* Verified the cloned repository folder structure and contents locally.

### 3. Opening Repository in VS Code

* Opened the cloned repository folder inside **Visual Studio Code** for development.
* Ensured the repository is recognized as a Git project within VS Code.

---

### 4. `.gitignore` Setup

* Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude files and folders that should not be tracked by Git.
* Added the following lines to `.gitignore`:

```
.vscode/
.venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.DS_Store
```

* This prevents tracking of:

  * VS Code workspace settings (`.vscode/`)
  * Python virtual environment files (`.venv/`)
  * Python cache files
  * MacOS system files

---

### Next Steps

* Set up a local Python virtual environment and install required packages.
* Begin exploratory data analysis on the selected dataset.
* Develop the project notebook following project specifications.
